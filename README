These are files for use on a private cluster to which Austin and I have access.  This probably won't do you much good or be that interesting for a while.


Steps to get this running:

1. Log into the cluster.
2. Run this:
    git clone git://github.com/wil-langford/austin-game-taxonomy.git
    bash austin-game-taxonomy/utils/cluster-python-environment-setup.sh
3. (optional) Add $HOME/bin to your PATH in .bash_profile.
4. cd austin-game-taxonomy
5. Run this:
    make run
    less data/master.dat
